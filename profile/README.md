## PhosphorusMedia

Phosphorus aims to be a multi-interface tool for streaming and downloading music from varius sources. This project took inspiration
from [Nuclear](https://github.com/nukeop/nuclear), a project that already offers all the functionalities that Phosphorus should provide, but
suffers from a heavy user experience and an excessively high response time.

Phosphorus is currently very far away from being a usable product, but [phosphorus_cli](https://github.com/PhosphorusMedia/phosphorus_cli)
already provides a primitive and experimental terminal-based interface that allows streaming and downloading content from Youtube. In fact,
right now, the only supported source is Youtube, through the [youtube_dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) tool. On the ```better_ui``` branch, a
better and more complete UI is being implemented, but neither streaming not download are available, for now.
